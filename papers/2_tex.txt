abstract = {With the advancement of technology intelligent devices are fast approaching the realm of necessity from the status of luxury. With limited energy resources, it is the need of time to revolutionize the traditional methods of counting visitors inside hotels, recreational places, meeting rooms and cinemas to control the electrical appliances. Moreover, the improved living standards demand developing circuits that would ease the complexity of life. Many systems have been developed to fill this technological gap but most of them are not applicable in real time scenarios due to their limitations. This paper describes the development and implementation of real time bidirectional visitor counter along with automatic room light controller. The proposed system keeps track of visitors visiting a room as well as takes over the control of the room lights. As a visitor enters the room, the count is incremented by one and the lights are switched on. While the count is decremented if a person leaves the room. Lights of the room are switched off only if there is no person inside. Though a number of systems have been developed in this field but most of them are not practically applicable due to outdated technology. In this paper, we have used state of the art components to develop a practically applicable system. Finally, the system was deployed and tested in real world situations to enumerate its efficiency.},
