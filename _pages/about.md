I am a doctoral student at the [Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield (UK)](http://dcs.shef.ac.uk) since 2021. I am working on multilingual speech recognition systems at `LivePerson centre for Speech and Language Technologies (SLT)` under supervision of [Prof. Thomas Hain](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/people/academic/thomas-hain). My PhD reserach revolves around cross-lingual acoustic-phonetic similarities. Being part of LivePerson centre, I am also associated with [Speech and Hearing (SPANDH)](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/spandh), and [Machine Intelligence for Natural Interfaces (MINI)](https://mini.dcs.shef.ac.uk/) reserach groups.

Alongside my PhD, I am also working as Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) for various modules at University of Sheffield. Currently, I am assisting teachers for Machine Learning and Adaptive Intelligence, and Data Science with Python. Please visit the [teaching](/teaching/) page for details.

Before enrolling for my Ph.D., I was a pre-doc research intern at [Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (UFAL)](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/home-page), Charles University, Prague. I primarily worked on speech related components of EU Horizon 2020 project `European Live Translator (ELITR)` supervised by [Dr. Ondrej Bojar](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/ondrej-bojar).

Prior to joining the UFAL, I have been working as speech processing Research Officer at [Center for Language Engineering (CLE), University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Lahore](https://cle.org.pk/). I joined CLE during my senior year as a speech scientist to develop low resource language technologies in supervision of [Dr. Sarmad Hussain](https://www.cle.org.pk/information/people/drsarmadhussain.html).
I received my M.Sc. and B.Sc. Electrical Engineering degrees from [UET, Lahore](https://uet.edu.pk/) in 2019 and 2017 respectively.
