I have started working as an Applied Research Scientist at [Emotech Ltd.](https://www.emotech.ai/) right after my PhD completion.

In July 2024, I have graduated as a PhD from the [Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield (UK)](http://dcs.shef.ac.uk) which I joined in 2021. During my PhD, my research focus have been low-resource and multilingual speech recognition at the `LivePerson Centre for Speech and Language Technologies (SLT)` under the supervision of [Prof. Thomas Hain](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/people/academic/thomas-hain).  Being part of the LivePerson Centre, I am also associated with [Speech and Hearing (SPANDH)](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/spandh), and [Machine Intelligence for Natural Interfaces (MINI)](https://mini.dcs.shef.ac.uk/) research groups. My PhD at University of Sheffield has really been fun with some amazing colleagues and in a healthy research environemnt. I not only enjoyed my own research work, I had the chance to collaborate with my colleagues on other projects too. You can find our publications on the Publications page.

Alongside my PhD, I have also developed a short course on '[Unsupervised Machine Learning](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/research-training/research-training?authuser=3#h.1eb5jfpdedbz)' for non-experts as a 'Training Assiatnt' at the University of Sheffield. I am also delivering sessions on [Python programming](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/research-training/research-training?authuser=3#h.hgfa3iwremo8) to non-experts (faculty members and PhD students from social science departments). I have also worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) for various modules at the University of Sheffield. I have assisted module leaders for various modules including 'Machine Learning and Adaptive Intelligence' and 'Data Science with Python'. Please visit the [teaching](/teaching/) page for details.

Before enrolling for my Ph.D., I have worked as a pre-doc research intern at [Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (UFAL)](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/home-page), Charles University, Prague. I primarily worked on speech-related components of the EU Horizon 2020 project `European Live Translator (ELITR)` supervised by [Dr. Ondrej Bojar](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/ondrej-bojar).

Prior to that, I worked as a speech processing Research Officer at [Center for Language Engineering (CLE), University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Lahore](https://cle.org.pk/). I joined CLE during my senior year as a speech scientist to develop low-resource language technologies under the supervision of [Dr. Sarmad Hussain](https://www.cle.org.pk/information/people/drsarmadhussain.html).
I received my M.Sc. and B.Sc. Electrical Engineering degrees from [UET, Lahore](https://uet.edu.pk/) in 2019 and 2017 respectively.
